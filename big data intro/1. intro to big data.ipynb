    "# Understanding Big Data, Challenges, and the Hadoop Platform\n",
    "\n",
    "## Evolution of Big Data\n",
    "\n",
    "- Initially, data was structured and manageable using traditional systems.\n",
    "- As data formats expanded (JSON, XML, images, videos, documents), traditional RDBMS began to struggle.\n",
    "- This led to the need for classifying data into:\n",
    "  - **Structured:** Follows rows and columns (e.g., relational databases).\n",
    "  - **Semi-structured:** Uses key-value pairs but not strictly tabular (e.g., JSON, XML).\n",
    "  - **Unstructured:** No defined pattern (e.g., PDFs, images, videos, text files).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problems with Big Data and Their Solutions\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Emerging Big Data Challenges (The 3 Vs):\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Variety:** Different types of data accumulated (structured, semi-structured, unstructured).\n",
    "- **Volume:** Massive size of the data being generated.\n",
    "- **Velocity:** High speed at which data is generated and collected.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solutions to Big Data Problems\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Monolithic Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "- One large and robust system (e.g., Teradata).\n",
    "- Centralized infrastructure with vast resources (CPU, RAM, storage).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Limitations:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Scalability:** Vertical scaling required (adding more powerful hardware).\n",
    "- **Fault Tolerance:** Single point of failure — if it crashes, the entire system goes down.\n",
    "- **Cost:** High initial investment, even when not fully needed. Difficult to maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Distributed Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "- Many smaller systems working together in a cluster.\n",
    "- Each node contributes to storage and processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Scalability:** Horizontal scaling — add more machines to the cluster as needed.\n",
    "- **Fault Tolerance:** Failure of a single node doesn’t affect the whole system.\n",
    "- **Cost-Effective:** Start small, use commodity hardware, rent infrastructure (e.g., cloud services).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hadoop Platform\n",
    "\n",
    "- An open-source framework for distributed storage and processing of large datasets.\n",
    "- Designed to address the volume, velocity, and variety of big data.\n",
    "- Uses commodity hardware and enables horizontal scalability.\n",
    "- Key components:\n",
    "  - **HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System):** For storing big data across multiple machines.\n",
    "  - **MapReduce:** A programming model for processing data in parallel.\n",
    "  - **YARN (Yet Another Resource Negotiator):** Manages computing resources in clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "# Broad Classes of Software Types\n",
    "\n",
    "1. System Software\n",
    "- Operating systems and utility programs that manage hardware and software.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Programming Languages\n",
    "- Tools to write software (e.g., Java, Python, C++).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Desktop Applications\n",
    "- Standalone software installed on personal computers (e.g., MS Office, Photoshop).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Data Processing Technologies\n",
    "- Early example: **COBOL** — one of the first serious attempts at data processing.\n",
    "- Allowed storing and processing data in files.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. RDBMS (Relational Database Management Systems)\n",
    "- Examples: MySQL, SQL Server, Teradata.\n",
    "- Provided features like:\n",
    "  - SQL for querying.\n",
    "  - Scripting with PL/SQL, T-SQL.\n",
    "  - ODBC and JDBC for programming language interaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Internet-Led Innovations\n",
    "- Led to development of websites and web applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Platform Development\n",
    "- Tools and environments for building and running applications (e.g., Java Platform, .NET).\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Cloud Computing\n",
    "- On-demand delivery of computing resources via the internet (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud).\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Machine Learning and AI\n",
    "- Advanced techniques to make systems intelligent and data-driven.\n",
    "- Applications in data analysis, prediction, automation, and more.\n"
